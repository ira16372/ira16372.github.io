## PREJUDICED ANALYSIS

A quick review of some of the major events that occured during Obama's tenure gives a diverging view on the foreign policy of the Barack Obama Government.

At first, Obama’s foreign policy can be perceived as pragmatic in light of the transition away from any theoretical approaches towards analysing international relations and toward a more collaborative approach to foreign policy based on economic policy, human rights, and climate change.<br>
Obama can be credited with legalising the LGBTQ rights, which was consequently followed in many other countries.<br>
He is also responsible for creating mass awareness for Climate Change and Global Warming. More importantly, he has been instrumental in enforcing regulations that was in the best interest of the environment and the people, collectively.<br>
Given the evermore interconnected world we live in, being apprehensive of a Cold War and conducting a proxy-war for the same is redundant. Barack Obama was able to establish a foreign policy that induced a thoughtful approach to this apprehension. Some concrete examples in this regard are:<br>
* Paris Climate Change Agreement
* Cuba Rapprochement
* Killing of Osama Bin Laden
* Iran Nuclear Agreement

<br>

Some events, however, display a completely different orientation of Obama's working methodology.<br>
During his tenure, a distinctive political climate with only two military powers in the world (that can locally challenge the USA) developed.<br>
China & Russia, both, happen to be nuclear-armed, nationalist, gangster-run dictatorships and are more or less autonomous in decisions that affect the world.<br>
The decision of exonerating Russia for invading and annexing parts of Georgia in 2008 led directly to Russia’s decision to annex the Crimea and capture the Ukrainian navy, marking a monumental change in USA’s ability to contain Russian aggression.<br>
Considering China has received the same treatment even after the conflict over South China Sea shows Obama's explicit interest in maintaining peaceful relations with these superpowers.
This might have been able to remove the fear of any immediate second cold war with Russia or China.

Most analysts believe that the US foreign policy was in a state of absolute mess due to George Walker Bush.<br>
<br>

> "Obama has been mending the fences that Bush destroyed. The dynamic went from a sort of cold war to an extremely hot one. And President Obama was presented with a number of choices, all bad, from which he had to try to pick the less bad ones. This is not a recipe for success in the region."
> - Ernest W. Adams

## WORST POLICY MISTAKES

The most evident mistakes by Obama, in my personal order of priority, are:<br>
* Pulling down Colonel Gaddafi's regiment
* The Russia policy and reaction on Ukraine
* Syria Red Line incident.
* Accepting the Nobel Peace Prize

According to Obama himself, it was how his administration dealt with Libya after Gaddafi was removed from power.<br>
When asked in an interview his worst mistake, he replied:<br>
> “Probably failing to plan for the day after, what I think was the right thing to do, in intervening in Libya.”<br>[[ref]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/obamas-worst-mistake-libya/478461/)

The mistake wasn’t going after Gaddafi, but rather the lack of foresight in what would happen in Libya after his removal. Obama mentioned in an [interview](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36013703) with *The Atlantic* that Libya was now “a mess.”

When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, it created unrealistic expectations from his presidency. Obama himself was doubtful about the nomination and confessed his apprehensions in a follow-up interview.<br>
The acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize forced him to take not liberalistic, not realistic, but diplomatic decisions, which led to the foreign policy developing a split-personality. This diplomacy led to the US being inconsistent in what it will do (or not do) and taking unpredictable decisions, like making a formal statement asserting their disinterest in Libya and then being responsible for one of the most non-strategic mistakes. Libya could otherwise have been a European mission without the buck being passed on to the USA.<br>
Indirectly, Syria too, would not be the mess it would be today were it not for that inconsistent policy.<br>
This diplomacy affected most international relations, not necessarily in the negative sense though.

## OBAMA AND THE MIDDLE EAST

Limiting the domain of discussion to the Middle East, Obama's foreign policy can come off as lacking strategy, which I honestly feel is a wrong remark.
Foreign Policies aren't solely determined by a country's military involvement in other states.<br>
Obama employed a coherent strategy to undertake major initiatives on the problems he viewed as rising to the level of core national security interests: Iran’s nuclear weapons program, terrorism, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the war in Iraq.<br>
Owing to Obama's administration failure in realising the promises he raised in his inspirational speeches, there exists a huge gap between Obama's analytical success and his operational failures. Following his trend of diplomacy, Obama's policies infuriated partisans who received honest treatment, instead of unconditional support from the US.[[ref]](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/obama-and-middle-east)

Beyond resolving old wars, Obama tried to keep the USA out of any more wars. He understood that interventions don't usually work the way they are planned out and maybe this is the reason why he kept the United States out of Syria’s quagmire, except for reportedly providing covert support for rebel groups despite immense pressure to do otherwise, which turned out to be an enormously wise decision.

### Iran
Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a major threat to global security, yet there has never been a viable military option for checking the country’s nuclear ambitions, whether it was Israel acting alone or a U.S.-led coalition. Sanctions could hurt Iran’s economy and put pressure on its leadership, but they could never on their own force it to resist an unwanted demand.<br>
That left only diplomacy and a monumental doubt whether two suspicious powers could strike a balanced deal. Obama's administration arrived at a deal that met the core needs of each side, with majority of the masses and democrats in favour of the Iran Nuclear deal.

### Relations with Islamic State
The administration’s refusal to intervene in Syria had challenged expectations of US power. Although it upset the perceived regional balance of power and conflict, Obama’s strategy against the Islamic State exemplifies his broader view on realism. Obama recognized the threat but did not exaggerate it. He responded to the Iraqi government’s requests for assistance against the Islamic State with greater aid, air strikes, and the limited reintroduction of military advisers, but did not take a direct, active participation in the proceedings.
Many more of Obama's actions in the Middle-East can be debated on only to discover that the structural realities of the region justify Obama’s vision.

## OBAMA AND ASIA

### Dominant States
China’s rise after ASEAN and China's pact over South China Sea posed a broad challenge for U.S. foreign policy because China might try to overrule the existing code of conduct in the South China Sea. Obama helped make significant progress on some issues, but the U.S.-Chinese security relationship and the Asia-Pacific region in general are far more tense today than they were at the start of 2009, even though Obama administration has generally done well under what have been extremely difficult circumstances.

The Obama administration made a lot of efforts to actually maintain and strengthen peaceful relations with major countries in Asia. The administration<br>
* sent top officials to Asia more frequently than its predecessor
* improved relations with Burma (also called Myanmar)
* signed treaties and established pacts such as the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia and U.S. China Strategic and Economic Dialogue
* joined the East Asia Summit
* established the U.S.-South Korean Alliance
* initiated operation Tomodachi in Japan

Although Barack Obama was criticized for his lack of an early response to the foreign policy with India, he nullified most of those remarks by mentioning India as as "America's indispensable ally in the South Asian region".
India has a strong foothold in South Asia owing to the vital lanes of the Indian Ocean and is of huge military interest to the U.S.
> "I can tell you quite definitively that due to our partnerships, several terrorism plots were foiled."<br>
> - Peter Lavoy, Senior Director for South Asian Affairs at the U.S. National Security Council, on the military partnership between India and the U.S. ([[ref]](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Many-a-terror-plot-foiled-due-to-India-U.S.-cooperation-White-House/article17008284.ece):  The Hindu, January 12, 2017)

Strategic alliance with India serves to keep India's neighbouring disturbed regions in strict check. But the administration has made some notable mistakes in the areas of rhetoric and public diplomacy. The Obama administration’s initial attempts at reassurance backfired by creating false expectations in China that the new administration was going to be much more accommodating than its predecessors. These hopes were dashed when, in early 2010, the Obama administration behaved in a very traditional manner, selling arms to Taiwan, criticizing Beijing for infringing on Internet freedom, and arranging for the president to meet with the Dalai Lama. Because of the earlier positive rhetoric, this continuation of standard policy came as a real disappointment in China, feeding feelings of betrayal and producing domestic demands for a tougher foreign policy.

### East Asian Relations

These days, tensions in East Asia are significantly greater than they were in January 2009, and the United States finds itself using military assets on a fairly frequent basis to send signals to Beijing about U.S. interests in the East China and South China Seas. But despite Chinese complaints to the contrary, these tensions were not manufactured in Washington, and at various times, the Obama administration has adopted constructive policies to reduce them.<br>
Once Beijing demurred from cooperating on reining in North Korea, Washington turned to Japan and South Korea to coordinate a reaction to Pyongyang’s belligerence, which ultimately led to enhanced intelligence cooperation among the three countries and U.S.–South Korean exercises in the Yellow Sea.<br>
North Korea has been a major trouble area, and its relations with the U.S. have strained steadily. Even though North Korea has never been audacious enough to challenge the U.S. directly, incidents like the sinking of a South Korean Navy ship in 2010, and bombardment of Yeonpyeong have definitely triggered response from South Korea's allies. 

At the ASEAN Regional Forum in July 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton noted that although the United States took no position on the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, it expected them to be managed peacefully. A constructive and well-formed position of all disputants clarifying their claims in ways consistent with the international law was widely supported by most of Southeast Asia but elicited a bullying diplomatic response from the Chinese foreign minister. Beijing thereby alienated China’s southern neighbors and coerced them to cooperate with the United States and with one another in ways that might have long-term payoffs for U.S. interests in the region. [[ref]](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/obama-and-asia)<br>
Chinese-Japanese relations, meanwhile, grew tense after Japanese authorities arrested the captain of a Chinese fishing boat near the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in September 2010. To temper China’s reaction, the United States reiterated its long-standing policy toward the islands: it takes no position on their underlying sovereignty but recognizes Japan’s administrative control.

## OBAMA AND EUROPE

### Ukraine

In the wake of the **Euromaidan protests**, the Obama administration had embraced the new government of Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. After Russia began to occupy the Crimean peninsula Obama warned Russia of *severe consequences* if Russia annexes the region and attempted to negotiate a withdraw of Russian troops. To date, all negotiations have been unsuccessful. <sub>(Source: Paul Adams (2014-03-14). "No Ukraine accord in US-Russia talks". BBC News. Retrieved 2016-11-09)</sub><br>
<br>
Russia annexed the region,  committing the previous decade's one of the most important international events and covering headlines all around the world, and Obama's administration was liberalistic enough to grant exoneration to Russia.<br>
Like stated earlier, the U.S. under Obama's government was really inconsistent with statements and warnings, and once again had shown a diplomatic approach just to maintain peaceful relations.<br>
Maybe Obama was mature enough to understand that an event of such magnitude can be reversed only if peaceful relations are maintained, which caused him to take this decision.
On December 18, 2014 Obama signed into law Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014.<br>
Obama's foreign policy seems to be heavily tied down between doing what is right and diplomacy.<br>

### Russia
Tensions remained as Russia pushed back against attempts at further eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union into areas that had previously been part of the Russian Empire and the USSR. Obama's Russian reset made headlines in 2009, but critics debated whether or not it could improve bilateral relations or was about to concede too much to Russia.
At the end of March 2014, president Obama dismissed Russia as a "regional power" that did not pose a major security threat to the U.S. The statement was later sharply criticised by Putin as ″disrespectful″ and an attempt to prove America's exceptionalism.
> ″We have a lot to learn about the depths of Russia, we are very ignorant about it at the moment. ... Russia is not, as President Obama said, ′a regional power′. This was a big error in assessment.″
> - Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.

After Russia′s military intervention in Syria in 2015 and the alleged interference in the 2016 election campaign in the U.S., relations between the Russian government and Obama administration became more strained. In September 2016, the U.S. government publicly accused Russia of ″flagrant violations of international law″ in Syria. Thomas Friedman opined, ″Obama believed that a combination of pressure and engagement would moderate Putin's behavior. That is the right approach, in theory, but it's now clear that we have underestimated the pressure needed to produce effective engagement, and we're going to have to step it up. This is not just about the politics of Syria and Ukraine anymore. It's now also about America, Europe, basic civilized norms and the integrity of our democratic institutions.″

In mid-November 2016, the Kremlin accused president Obama's administration of trying to damage the U.S.′ relationship with Russia to a degree that would render normalisation thereof impossible for the incoming administration of Donald Trump.<br>
Obama's foreign policy was taken in the wrong light, mostly, when it came to Russia, and stressed situations could have been averted following a change in perspective from strict realism to neo-liberalism, something closest to the diplomacy that Obama's government was trying to achieve.

> "The president's charisma and rhetorical skill are real diplomatic assets. If Mr. Obama can deploy them to improve America’s image and influence around the world, that is all to the good. There is nothing wrong with trying to re-build American 'soft power' "
> - Gideon Rachman, Financial Times

## GLOBAL INFLUENCE

### LGBTQ+ Rights

Even though Obama himself, at first, was against the LGBTQ idea of gender orientation, he changed his opinion soon enough, whether under diplomacy or not, and legalised many LGBTQ rights, essentially throwing the world into a movement of sensitisating itself with the LGBTQ community, if not legalising same-sex marriage.

<br>

### Osama bin Laden's Termination

One of the most happening events of this decade has been bin-Laden's termination. Obama continued the drone strikes (originally initiated by George W. Bush) and maintained active vigilance of the North West Pakist region, finally avenging the 9/11 attacks on May 2, 2011.<br>
The final execution involved a lot of **preceding false positives**, creating massive side effects.

### Paris Climate Deal

73 nations, accounting for 57 percent of the total greenhouse emissions, are fully committed to this deal. Obama was appreciated for giving a speech that invited collaboration and compromise, because climate change is something that one super-power can't do alone.


### Black Lives Matter Movement

Although the movement originally originated from a simple trend on Twitter, it gained widespread awareness following Obama's speech in 2013 where he asserted the grudging admission that 'people are racist'. Several rallies have been conducted since the origination of this movement.

## CONCLUSION

### Domestic Perspective

Considering only the U.S., Obama set up a legacy in domestic achievements. His tenure was marked by a huge reduction in U.S. budget deficit and crime rates owing to *gun-culture*.

![budget](/assets/budgetdeficit.jpg)![crimes](/assets/crimerate.png)

<br>

### International Perspective

Considering the world, however, I feel that Obama was **not** a realist, period.<br>
His foreign policy would not have been so scarred had he been a realist.<br>
The following map represents the world's confidence in Obama. It is obvious that after back to back crises in the Middle-East, the nations there have seriously low confidence in an otherwise appreciated leader.<br>

![obamaConfidence](/assets/obamaConfidence.png)

Focusing on his entire tenure, it can safely be concluded that Barack Obama's administration followed liberal internationalism. The U.S's investment in the world's need of humanitarian aid and military invasion has been precious and vitally important. Obama followed, and expected, good-faith and fair dealings in all international relations. This is one reason why U.S. allies were proud of their position and why U.S. enemies hated it, pretty much the way it should be.<br>
Although his failure to define U.S. interests eloquently and his tendency to recite the familiar rhetoric of liberal hegemony had unfortunate consequences, as already pointed out in the 'Worst Policy Mistakes' section.<br>
There is a strong need to redefine neo-realism, in a way that finds a middle ground foreign policy.<br>
Obama's foreign policy has been way too human and logical to be explained within the strict (and obsolete) boundaries of realism and liberalism.<br>

I also feel scholars are going to be kind  to Obama's foreign policies, because the key to Obama’s success has been his appreciation of the liberal international order together with his recognition.<br>
Analysing different events individually will create several images as a softheaded idealist, a cold-blooded realist, or a naive incompetent.
But it is only through gaining a grasp over the big picture that one can appreciate Obama's motive of being an ideological liberal with a conservative temperament, and one of the best diplomatic leaders history has ever witnessed.
